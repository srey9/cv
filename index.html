      <p>I am an aspiring actor who is trying to learn code in order to provide a living for myself as I pursue my dreams. All my life I wanted to be a professional actor and I found that it is very difficult to provide a life for yourself while trying
        to remain flexible. I think the key is finding a job that allows you to do the work anywhere, and at any time.  This being said, I think you still have to find a day job that you enjoy.  Some people say it's impossible, but I know better. 2020 here I come!</p></td>
